Key performance indices:
- Is the problem clear?
- Are the assumptions sound?
- Are the selected algorithms the appropriate ones?
- Is the model selection sound?
- Is the validation sound?
- Are the results bringing new knowledge?
- How well can you describe the basic bilinear methods (PCA, PLSR) in few word on the whiteboard?

Remember to use both algorithms from our course and some other non-linear approach and then compare the performance (both numberically and in terms of understanding)
