# Basic spectroscopy

## Light as waves

- Sinusoidal waves
- Amplitude, wavelength, frequencyA
- Convenience: Complex mathematics

## Interference

### Two wave sources

- E: Sum of E1 and E2
- Intensity: Sum of squared amplitudes + Interference term (phase and path dependent)

### Several wave sources

- N waves from Sn coherent and monochromatic sources separated by distance a
- Phase difference due to different paths
- E: Rotating vector sum method

## Diffraction
